# A Light SRGAN for Low Rsolution and High Latency Images

### Repository for the [A Light SRGAN For Low Resolution and High Latency Images]() Presented at [ICACDS'21](https://icacds.com/)

The model, derived from original SRGAN is supposed to work on much smaller images and with a much higher noise value. The target of the paper was to create a Model that is fast, light and trained on a much smaller dataset and time.
