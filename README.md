# A Light SRGAN for Low Rsolution and High Latency Images

### Repository for the [Paper]() Presented at []()

The main goal of this experimentation was to successfully construct a SRGAN model that can compile and produce high quality results on any kind of device and be fast in doing so.
We were able to achieve near SoTA like performance with a final model that is less than 20MB is size.
